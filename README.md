# Windows-Movie Maker

**Authors**: Ning Chen, Joe Marx

## Overview

Tasked with helping Microsoft Corporation venture into the Film industry, this project analyzes the state of the filmindustry and looks at what kinds of films are most profitable and popular. 

A one-paragraph overview of the project, including the business problem, data, methods, results and recommendations.

## Business Problem

As the tech industry continues to evolve and mature, companies are expanding the scope of services they offer. To stay competitive with peer companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google, Microsoft can make original video content to offer itsmassive customer-base. Microsoft faces a number of obstacles to entering the industry—addressed in this project is the fact that Microsoft has no record producing studio films to base their business decisions from.

Summary of the business problem you are trying to solve, and the data questions that you plan to answer in order to solve them.

Questions to consider:
* What are the business's pain points related to this project?
* How did you pick the data analysis question(s) that you did?
* Why are these questions important from a business perspective?
***

## Data

Robust movie databases, such as the *International Movie Database* (IMDB) and *The Movie Database* keep records ofmost movie's produced and contain data on a movie's creative team as well as financial information on the movies. These two databases were the source for this project's data. The movie's sampled were randomly selected through *TMDB's* "discover API and by supplementing with a set of over 40,000 movies produced in the last five years. This project focuses mainly on return on investment using budget and global revenue data.

***
Questions to consider:
* Where did the data come from, and how do they relate to the data analysis questions?
* What do the data represent? Who is in the sample and what variables are included?
* What is the target variable?
* What are the properties of the variables you intend to use?
***

## Methods

Describe the process for analyzing or modeling the data. For Phase 1, this will be descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How did you prepare, analyze or model the data?
* Why is this approach appropriate given the data and the business problem?
***

## Results

Through

***
Questions to consider:
* How do you interpret the results?
* How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?

## Conclusions

We make the recommendation to Microsoft to consider making movies matching the [] genre. There is a trend of higher revenue per dollar spent in this category and so assuming profit maximization as the objective of this venutre, this is the safest choice from a business perspective. Please note, the scope of this project is limited only to the quantifiable data on movie production and doesn't attempt to look at artistic merit of a movie. This project also only looked at genre!!!!!!! as an input, and didn't include parameters such as artistic and marketing talent attached to movies. It will be challenging to disrupt this industry as a newcomer, especially one with historically high competition, and looking at what is successful among production companies that are already successful, may not offer the most useful insights in how to most effectively enter the market. It could prove more valuable to look at what other companies have done to make succssful sojourns into the industry.

Questions to consider:
* What would you recommend the business do as a result of this work?
* What are some reasons why your analysis might not fully solve the business problem?
* What else could you do in the future to improve this project?
